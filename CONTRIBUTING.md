### Opening a New Issue

- Please check the [README](README.md) to see if your question is answered there.
- Search [open issues](https://github.com/wizeline/WL-Android-ViewState/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) and [closed issues](https://github.com/wizeline/WL-Android-ViewState/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to avoid opening a duplicate issue.
- Avoiding duplicate issues organizes all relevant information for project maintainers and other users.
- If no issues represent your problem, please open a new issue with a good title and useful description.

- Information to Provide When Opening an Issue:
- ViewState version(s)
- Android version(s)
- Devices/Simulators affected
- Full crash log, if applicable
- A well-written description of the problem you are experiencing
- *Please provide complete steps to reproduce the issue*
- For UI related issues, please provide a screenshot/GIF/video showing the issue
- Search for a list of any issues that might be related

The more information you can provide, the easier it will be for us to resolve your issue promptly.

### Submitting a Pull Request

We maintain two permanent, protected branches: `master` and `development` also we follow the [Gitflow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) branching model.

`master` is for the latest production available code, so any bug fixes or documentation spelling fixes should be merged into this branch.

`development` is where we stage work for the *next* release, i.e., breaking API changes and related documentation updates. Contributors should gently encourage new pull-requests to point to the appropriate branch, and to rebase onto that branch if necessary.

When a new version is ready to be released, please create a pull request to merge `development` into `master`, named something like "Release 10.0". Then we can have some final discussion before we merge it into `master` and push the release out to the public.

**You should submit one pull request per feature, the smaller the pull request the better chances it will be merged.**
Enormous pull requests take a significant time to review and understand their implications on the existing codebase.
